# Stream
Stream is a Swift library that enables you to create scalable data pipelines for medium or large datasets.

## Features
Stream pipelines allow you to process large or even infinite collections efficiently by:
* Performing computation in parallel within each Stream.
* Running each Stream concurrently within a pipeline.
* Providing back-pressure mechanisms to control memory growth.

## Installation
You can install it via SwiftPM via:
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/cgarciae/Stream", from: "0.0.7")
```
It might work on other compatible package managers.

## Example
Any `Sequence` can be converted into a `Stream` via the `.stream` property, after that you can use its custom functional methods like `map`, `filter`, etc, to process the data in parallel / concurrently:
```swift
_ = getURLs()
    .stream
    .map {
        downloadImage($0)
    }
    .filter {
        validateImage($0)
    }
    .flatMap {
        getMultipleImageSizes($0)
    }
    .forEach {
        storeImage($0)
    }
```
`Stream` inherits from `LazySequence` so you can treat it like a normal Sequence for other purposes. 

#### Back-pressure
To manage resources you can use the `maxTasks` and `queueMax` parameters: 
```swift
_ = getURLs()
    .stream
    .map(maxTasks: 4, queueMax: 10) {
        downloadImage($0)
    }
    .filter(maxTasks: 2, queueMax: 15) {
        validateImage($0)
    }
    .flatMap(maxTasks: 5, queueMax: 25) {
        getMultipleImageSizes($0)
    }
    .forEach(maxTasks: 3,queueMax: 20) {
        storeImage($0)
    }
```
`maxTasks` will control the number of GCD Tasks created by the Stream, and `queueMax` will limit maximum amount of elements allowed to live in the output queue simultaneously. If the output queue is full tasks will eventually block and the Stream will halt until its consumer requests more elements.
